ForesightGPT is a web-based prediction tool that leverages OpenAI's GPT models to generate probabilistic forecasts based on user-defined parameters.

**[Live Demo Here](https://thatsinewave.github.io/ForesightGPT)**

</div>

## Features

- **AI-Powered Predictions**: Utilize OpenAI's GPT models (GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5 Turbo) to generate intelligent predictions
- **Customizable Parameters**: Define and adjust the relevant factors affecting your prediction
- **Visual Results**: View outcomes as clear probability charts and confidence indicators
- **Detailed Analysis**: Get comprehensive explanations of prediction reasoning
- **Key Factors Identification**: Understand which parameters have the most significant impact
- **Local API Key Storage**: Your OpenAI API key is stored securely in your browser's local storage only

## How It Works

1. **Configure API**: Enter your OpenAI API key and select a model
2. **Define Your Question**: Enter what you want to predict
3. **Set Parameters**: Add relevant factors with their value ranges and importance weights
4. **Generate**: Get detailed probabilistic predictions with visual representations
5. **Analyze**: Review the detailed explanation and key influencing factors

## Requirements

- An OpenAI API key with access to GPT models
- A modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
- Internet connection to access the OpenAI API

## Privacy & Security

- Your OpenAI API key is stored only in your browser's local storage
- No data is sent to any servers except directly to OpenAI's API
- All processing happens in your browser

## Obtaining an OpenAI API Token

To use ForesightGPT, you need a valid OpenAI API key with an active payment method to avoid quota errors. Follow these steps to set up your API key properly:

### Step 1: Create an OpenAI Account

1. Go to [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/signup).
2. Sign up using your email, Google, or Microsoft account.
3. Verify your email address and log in.

### Step 2: Generate an API Key

1. Once logged in, navigate to the [API Keys page](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
2. Click **Create a new secret key** and copy it.
   - Store this key securely, as it will not be shown again.

### Step 3: Add a Payment Method

1. Go to [Billing](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing).
2. Click **Set up payment method** and enter your credit/debit card details.
3. OpenAI requires an active payment method to continue using the API beyond the free trial quota.

### Step 4: Check Your Usage & Limits

1. Visit the [Usage page](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage) to monitor your token consumption.
2. If you exceed your quota, you may need to increase your **soft limit** or add more funds in the [Limits section](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits).

### Step 5: Use Your API Key in ForesightGPT

1. Open ForesightGPT and enter your API key in the settings.
2. Ensure your key is valid and has sufficient quota to avoid errors.

**Tip:** OpenAI may grant a free trial with limited credits. Once used up, you'll need to switch to a paid plan to continue making API requests.

## Installation for Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ThatSINEWAVE/ForesightGPT.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd ForesightGPT
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser or use a local development server.

## Cost Considerations

This tool uses the OpenAI API which may incur charges to your account based on token usage. GPT-4 provides the most accurate predictions but costs more per API call. GPT-3.5 Turbo is more cost-effective for frequent use.

## Usage Tips

- **Be Specific**: The more precise your prediction question, the better the results
- **Relevant Parameters**: Include all factors that might influence the outcome
- **Weight Appropriately**: Assign higher weights (1-10) to more influential factors
- **Multiple Scenarios**: Run predictions with different parameter values to compare outcomes

## Limitations

- Predictions are probabilistic estimates, not guarantees
- Results depend on the quality of parameters and their assigned weights
- The tool is subject to the limitations of the underlying OpenAI models
- Internet connection is required for generating predictions
